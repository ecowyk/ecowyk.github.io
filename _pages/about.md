I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Spatial Information and Digital Technology at the School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, expected to graduate in 2026. And I will be pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering at the School of Automation and Intelligent Sensing, **PAMI Lab**, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, starting in the fall of 2026.

During my undergraduate studies, I have actively participated in research projects and academic competitions in the fields of computer vision and robotics, winning several awards at the provincial and national levels. These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.
